After three very intense days at [Modelica Conference 2023](https://2023.international.conference.modelica.org/) full of FMI topics the FMI project hosted a special FMI Design Meeting open to visitors.

The goal was to get feedback and new ideas from FMI users and FMI supporting tool vendors. 

Besides FMI developers from Akkodis, AVL, Bosch, Dassault Systems, dSPACE, EKS-INTEC, Modelon, PMSF, Synopsys, and Wolfram MathCore, we had guests from Airbus, Boeing, Danfoss, Fraunhofer, IVH, The MathWorksâ“‡, Toshiba, TU Wien, University of Augsburg, University of South-Eastern Norway, Virtual Vehicle, and Volvo.

Thanks to the E.ON Energy Research Center of RWTH Aachen for the hospitality! 

We had very good discussions and developed new ideas to bring FMI forward. Stay tuned!
